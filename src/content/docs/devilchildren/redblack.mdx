## Glitches and Tricks
<details>
<summary>**Casino Manip**</summary>
It was discovered that the Casino can be manipulated in the PS1 version. By saving in front of the counter for *Big or Small* and reloading, the sequence of numbers reproduced is always the same. This has also been tested in the downloadable version available in the Playstation Store. The winning sequence is "small, small, big, big, small, big, big, big, small, big, small, small, big" - this will grant more than enough coins for the run.
