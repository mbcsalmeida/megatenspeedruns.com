- By pressing the A Button the first number is increased and by pressing B it's decreased. This number represents each of the attack effects in the game. By pressing X on a number, you can see the attack animation for the spell with that ID.
- By pressing the Up button, the second number is increased, and decreased with the Down button. This number represents the ID of every random encounter, including every boss fight. By pressing X on a number, you can change the current random encounter to whichever one's ID is selected.
- By pressing the Left button,the third number is increased and by pressing the Right number, it is decreased. This number represents the battle background. On pressing X, you can change the background to whichever one is selected.
